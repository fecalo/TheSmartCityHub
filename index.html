            <h2>About Smart Cities</h2>
            <p><span style="font-weight:700">Smart Cities</span> are technologically modern urban areas that use different types of electronic methods
			and sensors to collect specific data. Information gained from that data is used to manage assets, resources
			and services efficiently; in return, that data is used to improve operations across the city. Examples of
			smart cities include New York City, Barcelona, and London.</p>

            <h2>Characteristics of Smart Cities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Make more efficient use of physical infrastructure (roads, built environment and other physical assets)
				through artificial intelligence and data analytics in order to support a strong and healthy economic, social,
				cultural development.</li>
                <li>Engage effectively with local governance by use of open innovation processes and e-participation, 
				improving the collective intelligence of the city's institutions through e-governance, with emphasis placed
				on citizen participation and co-design.</li>
                <li>Learn, adapt and innovate and thereby respond more effectively and promptly to changing circumstances by 
				improving the intelligence of the city.</li>
                <li>Evolve towards a strong integration of all dimensions of human intelligence, collective intelligence, and also
				artificial intelligence within the city.</li>
                <li>Overall better quality of life for residents.</li>

            <h2>Smart City Technologies</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><span style="font-weight:700">Information and Communication Technology (ICT)</span> -  unified communications and the integration of 
				telecommunications (telephone lines and wireless signals) and computers, as well as necessary enterprise
				software, middleware, storage and audiovisual, that enable users to access, store, transmit, understand
				and manipulate information.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight:700">Internet of Things (IoT)</span> - physical objects (or groups of such objects) with sensors, processing ability, 
				software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet
				or other communications networks.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight:700">Smart Grids</span> - an important technology in smart cities. The improved flexibility of the smart grid permits 
				greater penetration of highly variable renewable energy sources such as solar power and wind power.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight:700">Mobile Devices</span> - allows citizens to connect to the smart city services.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight:700">Smart Homes</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight:700">Bicycle-Sharing Systems</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight:700">Smart Mobility</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight:700">Intelligent Transportation and CCTV Systems</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight:700">Digital Libraries</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-weight:700">Online Collaborative Sensor Data Management Platforms</span> - online database services that allow sensor owners to 
				register and connect their devices to feed data into an online
				database for storage and allow developers to connect to the database and build their own applications based on that data.</li>
				<li><span style="font-weight:700">Supporting Technology</span> - include remote work, telehealth, the blockchain, fintech, and online banking technology.</li>
				<li><span style="font-weight:700">Electronic Cards</span> - possess a unique encrypted identifier that allows the owner to log into a range of government provided 
				services (or e-services) without setting up multiple accounts. The single identifier allows
				governments to aggregate data about citizens and their preferences to improve the provision of services and to determine 
				common interests of groups.</li>
				<li><span style="font-weight:700">Retractable Bollards</span> - allow to restrict access inside city centers (i.e. to delivery trucks resupplying outlet stores).</li>
				<li><span style="font-weight:700">Energy Data Management Systems (EDMS)</span> - help to save cities energy by recording data and using it to increase efficiency.</li>
				<li><span style="font-weight:700">Cost-Benefit Analysis</span> - assess whether it is economically and ecologically beneficial to implement some technologies at 
				all, and also compare the cost-effectiveness of each technology among each other.</li> 
            </ol>

            <h2>The Frameworks of Smart Cities</h2>
            <ol>
				<li><span style="font-weight:700">Techonology</span> -  different combinations of technological infrastructure such as digital, intelligent, ubiquitous, wired, hybrid, and infocity, 
				interact to form the array of smart city technologies
				with varying levels of interaction between human and technological systems.</li>
				<li><span style="font-weight:700">Human</span> - the economy, knowledge networks, and human support systems, which in turn, fuel the creativity, learning, knowledge, and humanity
				of the people.</li>
				<li><span style="font-weight:700">Institutional</span> - investments in the human/social capital and IT infrastructure that fuel sustainable growth and enhance quality 
				of life, through participatory governance.</li>
				<li><span style="font-weight:700">Energy</span> - efficient application of integrated energy technologies in the city allowing the development of more self-sustaining 
				areas or even Positive Energy Districts that produce more energy than consume. Electric companies, working partnership with city officials, 
				technology companies and a number of other institutions, play key roles in the development of smart cities.</li>
				<li><span style="font-weight:700">Data Management</span> - a combination of data collection, processing, and disseminating technologies in conjunction with networking and 
				computing technologies and data security and privacy measures encouraging the application of innovation to promote the overall quality 
				of life for its citizens and covering dimensions that include: utilities, health, transportation, entertainment and government services.</li>
